Data Science Internship Projects
Overview
This repository contains three projects completed during my data science internship. These projects showcase my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling using Python and popular libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.

Projects Included:
Titanic Survival Prediction

Prediction of passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. Analyzed passenger demographics and features to predict survival probability.
Iris Flower Prediction

Classification of Iris flower species based on petal and sepal measurements. Explored the famous Iris dataset for introductory classification tasks.
Sales Prediction

Forecasting sales based on advertising expenditures on TV, Radio, and Newspaper. Used multiple linear regression to predict sales from advertising data.
